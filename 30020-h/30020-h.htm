<p>long long time ago,
there lived in a quiet
spot, a young man and his wife.
They had one child, a little
daughter, whom they both loved
with all their hearts. I cannot
tell you their names, for they have
been long since forgotten, but the
name of the place where they
lived was Matsuyama, in the
province of Echigo.</p>

<p>It happened once, while the little
girl was still a baby, that the
father was obliged to go to the
great city, the capital of Japan,
upon some business. It was too far
for the mother and her little baby
to go, so he set out alone, after
bidding them good bye, and
promising to bring them home
some pretty present.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

</div>

<p>The mother had never been further
from home than the next
village, and she could not help
being a little frightened at the
thought of her husband taking
such a long journey, and yet she
was a little proud too, for he was
the first man in all that country
side who had been to the big town
where the King and his great lords
lived, and where there were so
many beautiful and curious things
to be seen.</p>

<p>At last the time came when she
might expect her husband back, so
she dressed the baby in its best
clothes, and herself put on a pretty
blue dress which she knew her
husband liked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

</div>

<p>You may fancy how glad this
good wife was to see him come
home safe and sound, and how the
little girl clapped her hands, and
laughed with delight, when she
saw the pretty toys her father had
brought for her. He had much to
tell of all the wonderful things he
had seen upon the journey, and in
the town itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

</div>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought you a very
pretty thing,&rdquo; said he to his wife:
&ldquo;it is called a mirror. Look and
tell me what you see inside.&rdquo; He
gave to her a plain, white wooden
box, in which, when she had
opened it, she found a round piece
of metal. One side was white like
frosted silver, and ornamented
with raised figures of birds and
flowers, the other was bright as
the clearest crystal. Into it the
young mother looked with delight
and astonishment, for, from its
depths was looking at her with
parted lips and bright eyes, a
smiling happy face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img010.jpg" width="375" height="329" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; again
asked the husband, pleased at her
astonishment, and glad to show
that he had learned something
while he had been away. &ldquo;I see
a pretty woman looking at me, and
she moves her lips as if she was
speaking, and&mdash;dear me, how odd,
she has on a blue dress just like
mine!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, you silly woman,
it is your own face that you see,&rdquo;
said the husband, proud of knowing
something that his wife
didn&#8217;t know. That round piece of
metal is called a mirror, in the
town every body has one, although
we have not seen them in this
country place before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img011.jpg" width="375" height="554" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>The wife was charmed with her
present, and, for a few days could
not look into the mirror often
enough, for you must remember,
that, as this was the first time
she had seen a mirror, so, of
course, it was the first time she
had ever seen the reflection of
her own pretty face. But she considered
such a wonderful thing far
too precious for every day use,
and soon shut it up in its box
again, and put it away carefully
among her most valued treasures.</p>

<p>Years past on, and the husband
and wife still lived happily. The
joy of their life was their little
daughter, who grew up the very
image of her mother, and who was
so dutiful and affectionate that
every body loved her. Mindful of
her own little passing vanity on
finding herself so lovely, the mother
kept the mirror carefully hidden
away, fearing that the use of it
might breed a spirit of pride in her
little girl.</p>

<p>She never spoke of it, and
as for the father, he had forgotten
all about it. So it happened that
the daughter grew up as simple
as the mother had been, and knew
nothing of her own good looks,
or of the mirror which would have
reflected them.</p>

<p>But bye and bye a terrible misfortune
happened to this happy
little family. The good, kind mother
fell sick; and, although her daughter
waited upon her day and
night, with loving care, she got
worse and worse, until at last there
was no hope but that she must die.</p>

<p>When she found that she must
so soon leave her husband and
child, the poor woman felt very
sorrowful, grieving for those she
was going to leave behind, and
most of all for her little daughter.</p>

<p>She called the girl to her and
said; &ldquo;My darling child, you know
that I am very sick: soon I must
die, and leave your dear father
and you alone. When I am
gone, promise me that you will
look into this mirror every night
and every morning: there you will
see me, and know that I am still
watching over you.&rdquo; With these
words she took the mirror from its
hiding place and gave it to her
daughter. The child promised, with
many tears, and so the mother,
seeming now calm and resigned,
died a short time after.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" width="375" height="556" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now this obedient and dutiful
daughter, never forgot her mother&#8217;s
last request, but each morning and
evening took the mirror from its
hiding place, and looked in it
long and earnestly. There she saw
the bright and smiling vision of
her lost mother. Not pale and
sickly as in her last days, but the
beautiful young mother of long ago.
To her at night she told the story
of the trials and difficulties of the
day, to her in the morning she
looked for sympathy and encouragement
in whatever might be in
store for her. So day by day she lived
as in her mother&#8217;s sight, striving
still to please her as she had
done in her life time, and careful
always to avoid whatever might
pain or grieve her. Her greatest
joy was to be able to look in the
mirror and say; &ldquo;Mother, I have
been today what you would have
me to be.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img020.jpg" width="375" height="273" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Seeing her every night and
morning, without fail, look into the
mirror, and seem to hold converse
with it, her father at length asked
her the reason of her strange
behaviour. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I look in the mirror every day to
see my dear mother and to talk
with her.&rdquo; Then she told him of
her mother&#8217;s dying wish, and how
she had never failed to fulfil it.
Touched by so much simplicity,
and such faithful, loving obedience,
the father shed tears of pity
and affection.
Nor could he
find it in his
heart to tell
the child, that the image she saw in
the mirror, was but the reflection
of her own sweet face, by constant
sympathy and association, becoming
more and more like her dead
mother&#8217;s day by day.</p>
